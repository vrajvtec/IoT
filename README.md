# IoT

This is the Code for The Project with Pinouts.
The development board used is Espressif Systems ESP32 Devkit.
The same code can be used for Arduino Uno, Mega, Nano as well by some minor modifications.

Pin Outs.

 * D4 ----------> Humidity Relay
 * 
 * D13 ----------> Light Relay
 * 
 * D26 ----------> Temperature Relay
 * 
 * DHT Signal ----------> D5
 * 
 * Soil Moisture Input -------> VP (GPIO 36 also known as A0)  
 * 
 * LDR Input --------> D34 (With ADC)
